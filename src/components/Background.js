				My name is Tony, and I am a senior at Fort Hays State University
				pursuing a B.S. Computer Science. I also hold a BS in Accounting
				from SJSU. I have 5+ years of professional experience working in
				the accounting field as a Financial Controller/Senior Accountant
				for small start-ups. I have been coding as a hobby for the past
				few years, building a few projects in Python, JavaScript,
				Node.js, and React. In 2020, I decided to seriously pursue
				software engineering.

				In my free time, I find joy in learning new technologies (thank
				you Brad Traversy and Net Ninja!). I also enjoy bowling,
				board/video games, and spending time with my wife.
